As of 04/14/04...

 - find a way to use round bubbles without using Painter.drawRoundRect, 
because you can only specify the relative roundness of the corners. The corners
should have a fixed radius.

 - What should be done about messages that arrive while the screensaver 
is on?.

 - Clean up the messages queue. Why is the default timing for messages 
and tips calculated in class queueItem instead of in class Amor?

 - Reduce the delay between a showMessage is received and the bubble is 
actually shown.
